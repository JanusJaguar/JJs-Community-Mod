This is a project I started with making my 100th Tutorial.
(Insert link here)

The install is simple, add the Two folders your Zero Hour Directory 
or
Move the .BIG archive into your Zero Hour Directory 

The Objective of this Community Mod;

1. Share my work on the 100th tutorial with you, & its real.

2. For YOU to use as a jumping off point for your own modding creations

3. A small shortcut for some minor QOL updates

4. Maybe creating this Mod & Tutorial will introduce more into:

 - Modding Command & Conquer 
   
 - My YouTube Tutorials, Tutorial Suggestion/ideas & Discord

Thank you.
